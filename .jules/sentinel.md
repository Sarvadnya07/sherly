## 2026-04-27 - Hardcoded API Key & Timing Attack in API Authentication
**Vulnerability:** The API server (`src/sherly/remote_api/server.py`) had a hardcoded default API key (`"sherly123"`) as a fallback if the environment variable was missing. In addition, the authentication check `verify_key` compared the incoming key and expected key using the `!=` operator, making it vulnerable to a timing attack.
**Learning:** Hardcoded default secrets can be easily exploited if a production environment misses an environment variable configuration. Furthermore, standard string comparison operators in Python evaluate character-by-character and return early upon mismatch. This allows an attacker to brute force the API key by analyzing response times.
**Prevention:**
- Do not provide a fallback for sensitive environment variables; fail securely when required secrets are not provided.
- Always use constant-time comparison methods like `secrets.compare_digest` from the built-in `secrets` module when verifying security credentials, tokens, or API keys.
