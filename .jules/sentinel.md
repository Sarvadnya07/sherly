## 2023-10-27 - [Command Injection via Unvalidated System Commands]
**Vulnerability:** The System Agent (`system_agent.py`) executed arbitrary OS commands via the raw `run_command` function without validation.
**Learning:** System automation agents that execute parsed LLM output or user input as shell commands must always use a central validation gateway (whitelist/safety guard). Direct calls to raw execution functions bypass security layers.
**Prevention:** Always use `safe_exec` from `sherly.tools.terminal_tools` instead of `run_command` when dynamically executing shell commands from external inputs or LLM generation.
